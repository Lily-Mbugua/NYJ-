        <h1>Identity and Oppression: The Role of a Racist Nation in the Formation of the Black Feminine Psyche</h1>

            <p>Self-determination is a birthright that many Black women have famously fought for and been denied but got denied. Black women more specifically black mothers, have done the work to challenge and change this narrative and replace it. The most prevalant way this tranaslates is in the way they raise their children.   </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> Throughout the book 'Born a Crime', Patricia Noah, demonstrates this on how she rasies Trevor. A balance of tough love, discipline among other things but the most importantly: Freedom. Trevors' freedom was quite a paradox in itself. In one way, his 'freedom' was virtually non-existent, but his mother Patricia, allowed him to be him and did not supress his growth. She found a striking balance between discipline and with an iron fist while continously encouraging him to be his best self.</p>
            <br> </br>   
            <p> Patricia's singlehood was quite rebelious. She truly did live her life and i'm glad Trevor described her as her own woman. Typically, when a woman is described, its always in relation to someone other than her: A wife, mother, sister, daughter. Never just an individual. Also she shared someof her rather risque experinces as a young woman. It was the 80's a rater conservative time in South Africa still is in some ways but Patricia decided she was going to live life her way and if it bothered you that was a you problem. American writers, Audre Lorde and Trisha R. Thomas, engage in a compelling argument for black feminine autonomy attained through a rejection of social constructs, which Lorde calls ‘external directives’ (Lorde 58). The experiences portrayed in the book, Born a Crime, mirror Lorde’s argument that, ‘external directives’ are antithetical to human needs and individuality. This media analysis serves to examine the ways in which Lorde’s refutations of patriarchal and rascist domination in the development of an erotic identity agree with and depart from Patricia Noah’s own journey towards a more liberated self-identification.</p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> The external source examined in this essay is a new addition to the literary world. Born a Crime is a fun and extremely intense book that challenged the 'Streotypes' as to what Africa was and our experiences. Finally proved in more ways than one that Blackness is not a monolith from Trevor Noahs’ similarly titled comedy special 'Bon a Crime'. The book tackles familiar narratives of romance and identity and reimagines black femininity as a conflicting abstract: one of disillusionment and triumph. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> Starting the analysis by drawing a parallel between the opening chapters and Trevor's own journey across the chapters of the book, Trevor comes full circle in his understanding of self. His transformation into self-awareness is connected through the symbolic power of comedy as a uniting element. The opening scene depicts a 5-year-old Trevor at the burial. He is the only biracial or 'white'- as many people refered to him as, at the funeral, an experience -however, as much as 'privillege'it comes across its quitet isolating in and of itself. Still an adventuresome toddler with curly hair and fair skin, not fully realized in the suppression of his identity, Trevor jumps defiantly into trouble and is met with ridicule by his neighbours. The scenes described in Soweto are imbued with many race-specific experiences. Most apparent to an academic analysis, is Trevor Noah’s family (except his mother) enforcing a rule of black patriarchal oppression through her instruction of respectability politics and an early development of double-consciousness (Higginbotham) (Bois). </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> The outset of the book depicts a return to childlike joy. Trevor causing mischief and being stubborn and humorous tales of what his been up to with little regard to how dangerous other expectations held of him. unbothered by definitions of who he should be to contradict the reality of who she is.His journey back into his mind space represents the rediscovery of a deeply rooted sense of freedom.</p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> One can see how young black women like Patricia Noah descend into these identity crises. The policing of oneself is something young black children inherit through familial and social reprimanding and carry into adulthood. Something that she never fell 'victim to'. My perception is because she chose Trevor, she was mentally and emotionally prepared to raise a child, not only a child, but a biracial child at the height of Aparthied. During this point in time, I genuinely believe Patricia was the exception to the norm. Lorde speaks on this unfortunate inheritance developed from the school of patriarchal constraint, which is further influenced by white supremacist ideation. She elaborates on the ways in which the suppression of black women's erotic nature keeps them ‘docile’, ‘obedient’, and ‘externally defined’ (Lorde 58).</p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> Readers read Trevor Noah departs from and returns to happiness under her own terms. After identifying this parallel, it becomes important to provide some analysis for the bits in the middle. Namely, the ways in which an internalization of racism forces and keeps his true identity suppressed and isolated by others. </p>
            <br></br>
            <p> In conclusion, I am in awe of how much Patricia Noah raised Trevor. It must have been no easy feat. All Trevor's success is parallel to how he was raised. While we may never know the 'What If's' in our life, I truly believe had it not been for Patricia, Trevor would not be where he is today.</p>

         <h2>The silent hurdle: Being Productive during a pandemic</h2>

         <p>  Sweet, Sweet quarantine. At first, I’m sure this was amazing news with for most young people.  Time to catch up on some rest, bonding with the family, sleeping in, finally catching up on a few Netflix shows you’ve been looking forward to watching. During this time we were able to read some good books without interruption. One thing that’s been evident is coronavirus is here and here to stay. This is the new normal and we need to get used to it and adjust. Now, reality has set its course. Your children are at home full time because the schools are all closed. You still need to get office work done, keep the kids occupied, entertained and play the part of school teacher. </p>
         <br> </br>
         <p>  Now, reality is starting to kick in. Children are at home full time because schools are closed. Mainly rotting their brains with social media, YouTube, video games, you’re struggling to get work done, keep the youth / children occupied (in a productive manner). You’re probably going a little stir-crazy and developing cabin fever. You desperately want to go outside, but don’t want to catch the coronavirus and you certainly don't want to spread it to some else, especially if they’re older. </p>
         <br> </br>
         <p>  It looks like we will be hibernating in seclusion for a while. Our officials say it's only temporary. Most likely two more months will turn into six months—or longer—depending on how quickly we can contain the outbreak but at this rate and how our government is containing the virus? I doubt it.  </p>
         <br> </br>
         <p>  You now have a critical choice to make: you can either waste away the moments that make up a dull day or use this time to your advantage. You can continue binge-watching television and munching on snacks or you could embark upon a campaign of self-improvement and helping others or better yet teach yourself that new skill, get on that diet, pray, do some yoga, everything you kept saying you don’t have time for? Now’s the time to do it. My advice is take a more challenging path and allocate your time toward productive and meaningful endeavors. First and foremost, one of the most important things one should have is a routine / learn how to manage your time. It’s too easy to let the hours, days and weeks fly by without doing anything constructive. Use this extra time as a gift to be proactive. Put together a schedule that incorporates all of the things that you want to accomplish and make sure you follow through on engaging in the activities. </p>
         <br> </br>
         <p>  First things first, There’s nothing wrong with a little introspection. Take some quiet time to assess where you are in your life and career. Contemplate if you’re happy with who you are and what you’re doing. Be honest with yourself. There’s no benefit to pretending that everything is going great if it isn't. If you are not happy with your professional and personal life, start developing a strategy to achieve your goals. There’s this pressure out there, almost on all social media platforms. You have to do this, that, be a better individual. While there is a point to this and keep progressing as a human being, you need rest and getting yourself to a good place mentally. </p>
         <br> </br>
         <p>  Maximizing your time to improve and help others is a wise decision. Instead of feeling helpless, sorry for yourself and complaining about the current state of affairs, you’ll gain control over your life. When it's all over, you’ll enjoy a great sense of accomplishment and appreciate that you didn’t squander precious weeks or months of your life.</p>
         <br> </br>
         <p>  If you are worried about the safety of your job—in light of the current mess we’re in—or were downsized, you can start an aggressive job search. Reach out to all of your contacts as they are stuck at home too and have no excuse for ignoring your requests for help. Put together a list of companies that you’d like to work for. Target internal corporate recruiters and folks who look like they’d be hiring managers and send out LinkedIn InMails and messages to them. Update your résumé, freshen up your LinkedIn profile, reach out to top recruiters in your space and practice your interviewing techniques. Interact on social media to build your brand and get noticed. </p>
         <br> </br>     
         <p>  Read up on new developments, digest industry-specific blogs, newsletters, articles and books.  </p>
         <br> </br>
         <p>  It's not just work-related stuff. Use this time wisely to lift yourself up intellectually. Download and read books that will help you gain more knowledge. If you don’t like reading and have a short attention span, there’s a wealth of great podcasts and YouTube videos that can help you with self-improvement, learning about new topics and staying abreast of fast-changing events.  </p>

        <h3> Colonialism </h3>

        <br> </br>
            <p> Colonialism is the direct and overall domination of one country by another on the basis of state power being in the hands of a foreign power. The first objective of colonialism is political domination. Its second objective is to make possible the exploitation of the colonized country. It is a phenomenon which is part and parcel of another phenomenon called imperialism. In fact, colonialism is a direct form of imperialism. This is why it is often said that” all colonialism is imperialism, but not all imperialism is colonialism” </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> Colonialism: We can all reach the general consensus that it was one of the most inhumane human acts of man kinds history. It’s extremely difficult to draw advantages from an act that was born out of tears, blood and pain. An event so catastrophic that it changed the course of the world and we still live in the ripple math of the damaged caused throughout the world especially in our home. Africa. The motherland, Treasure of the Earth. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> With this said, the human spirit, is crushed but never broken or destroyed. It’s unfortunate that it took a magnitude pain to reach here but like the phoenix, we rise and try again, coming back stronger and better than ever to finally be victors and emerge as the queens and kings we rightfully are. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p>Colonialism began as a result of changes in the mode of production in Europe (For example, the emergence of industrial revolution). The industrial revolution ushered in a new process of production in place of the earlier slave based economy. The industrial revolution was a revolutionary trend in the history of mankind. The problem of how to lubricate machineries came up with the emergence of the industrial revolution. The slave trade and slavery have by this time fulfilled their basic function of providing the primitive capital. The quest for the investment of the accumulated capital and the need for raw materials led to the colonization of Africa. This in itself is a paradox. On one hand, This was amazing for the British because it fueled their nations and made it the nation it is today, However this was a soul crushing life altering phenomenon that changed the trajectory of Africa and its people. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> Colonialism did not allow for industrialization of Africa. It assigned Africa the role of production of primary goods or raw materials in the international division of labour. Colonialism encouraged and intensified class struggle, tribalism and ethnicity within the African colonies. These were strategies introduced by the colonialists in order to perpetuate or prolong their rule and domination of African territories. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p> Colonialism shaped both the economic and political structure of African colonies to be in line with the need of the metropolis. It ensured that African economic and political structures both in form and content serve the interest of their home government (European powers). Colonialism therefore, in all intents and purposes was adisservice to Africa. </p>
            <br> </br>
            <p>  This may be an unpopular reason , As an African Woman, I do not think colonialism had any advantage, I wouldn’t call it an advantage because we paid for it in different ways. The cost of being “colonized”  outweigh any “advantage” we may have gained. We obviously picked up some things/ charcteristics from our collonisers but in doing so we lost part of our identity and culture. Nothing can be considered as an advantage if that was what it took to be colonized. </p>
